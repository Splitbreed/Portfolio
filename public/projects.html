      <div class="card-content">
        <p>A fully functioning Connect Four game, using jQuery, DOM manipulation, and HTML/CSS styling. This is the first major project I created while taking Web Development Immersive remote, and as such is very near to my heart. The game features full win detection, reset button, score tracking, and turn tracking, along with stylized CSS to provide visuals to the game.</p>

      <div class="card-content">
        <p>This app marks the second group effort and is a full CRUD application built on Ruby with an SQL database. Using postgresQL, Ruby on Rails, jQuery, Angular, and heavy styling with Materilize CSS, the website aims to provide a platform for users to find and favorite fonts. The landing pages of the site includes a jQuery plugin the queries the Google Font API and provides a multitude of choices. Two-way data binding allows the text-area to provide living, breathing feedback in terms of displaying the current font. The app is split into seperate repos, one for the front, and one for the back. Both are hosted on Heroku and are configured to speak to each other using CORS.</p>

        <p>A little bit of portfolio inception here! This is the current website you're on! It's a mostly HTML site built using Angular with ui-router to provide state information, and heavy use of Materialize.css for styling. It's one of my pride and joys! It even works well on mobile!!</p>

      <div class="card-content">
        <p>One of my most recent undertakings, this website was more to prove to myself that I could still easily put together a MEAN stack application with full CRUD. It's built using an Angular front end, with Node.js Express and MongoDB as the serverside and database handlers. The project also features angular flash, one of my favorite modules. The entire project was completed in roughly eight hours of work, and still has lots of room to be improved.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>A personal pet project of mine, this voice chat bot is built using the Discord.js library, which is built to wrap around the Discord voice application API. The bot is based on a self-help guru named Tai Lopez, and a viral video poking fun at one of his ads. The HIMG bot was intended to be used for fun between me and friends on our personal voice channels, but I have made it completely open source and easy to operate for anyone that wants to use it. Most recently, the bot now has the ability to play music via Google Play and YouTube, the commands for which can be accessed using the "Tai Help" command list. I fix bugs and add on to this bot consistently, and find it extremely fun to work with. Feel free to join and test him!</p>

        <p>The reworked version of the Tai Bot. Rebuilt to be cleaner, as the old version was a bit messy after the work done on him. I still intend to improve on him, but all improvements will occur on this version, not the old one!</p>
